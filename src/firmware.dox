/** \mainpage UoSÂ³ Flight Computer Firmware Documentation
 *
 * The firmware is built from a C main program file and resolves all the references and includes from the src/ and specified hardware folders
 *
 * The design is such so that the main hardware code and hardware can be easily varied. eg logic & processing modules go in the /src/<module>/ folder, but the actual board & hardware specific drivers go in the relevant /src/board/<board>/ folder. The main C application files are in /src/main/<application>.c
 *
 * For environment installation instructions, see README.md in the top level of the Repository.
