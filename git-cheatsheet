All you need:
1) git pull -> gets latest

2) git add <file> -> stage the file - you must do this for all files you want to be updated when you upload your changes

2) to commit (store to local version control) -> git commit -am "blurb around changes" (add files and message blurb) 

3) git push -> send local stored changes to server/remote repository

Helpful:
4) git status -> any conflicts?

5) git diff -> what is difference between them

6) overwrite current changes with network version -> git reset HEAD --hard

7) to build the executable binary see readme.md file

8) git branch -> see what branch you are on
   git branch -a -> see all branches
   git checkout <feature_branch> -> to switch branches (eg.: if you want to see progress of someone else)
